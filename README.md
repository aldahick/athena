# athena

I'm tired of rebuilding the same architecture over and over for REST & GraphQL APIs. Athena's goal is to consolidate and improve the best practices I try to follow, and make them extensible and reproducible.

The only logic in my server-side codebase should be application-specific business logic.

## Goals

- [ ] HTTP controllers
- [ ] GraphQL resolvers
- [ ] SQL databases
- [ ] MongoDB databases
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Authorization
- More, for sure

## Usage

See the demo codebase in `./src/demo`.
